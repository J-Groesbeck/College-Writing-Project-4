                    <p>As seen in figure 1, use of AI in business across the US has been steadily increasing over the
                        past few years, to where now close to 80% of businesses are using AI in some way. As AI advances
                        further, that number will continue to rise even higher. So, if so many businesses are using it,
                        it
                        must be helpful, right?

                    <p>Some may be surprised to learn that the answer is actually yes. As seen in figure 2, 72% of the
                        surveyed companies who used AI "extensively" reported a high level of productivity. And this
                        makes sense - if AI can be used to perform tasks faster, of course the productivity of the
                        companies who use it is higher. Take programming, for example. An AI can potentially produce up
                        to a few hundred lines of code in a matter of seconds, serving as a pretty good initial draft
                        that the developer can work off of. In other fields, AI can improve productivity in a similar
                        way. However, you may notice that there is a significant drop in productivity when you look at
                        the companies who reported using AI "fully." This is likely due to the plethora of mistakes AI
                        can make without even realizing it, leading to extra time spent fixing those mistakes and worse
                        products overall, if said mistakes are not caught.

                        can have extremely detrimental effects when it comes to AI use in business. A business that uses
                        AI and does not catch a mistake that an AI made can lead to a completely non-functioning or
                        potentially dangerous product. In other cases, it could lead to misinformation being spread far
                        and wide, which of course can be extremely damaging in several ways.

                    <p>Avni Patel is the creator of the Milo AI assistant, and describes in her TED talk why she created
                        it, and I believe it is the best way to show how AI can be useful in someone's personal life.
                        She created Milo in order to "reduce friction" in her busy life. She uses AI to keep track of
                        the busy schedules of herself and her kids, automatically add things to her schedule, and
                        overall keep her far more organized than she normally has the time to be. Using AI to get the
                        tedious and boring tasks of life out of the way quickly and efficiently is absolutely an
                        extremely useful way AI can be used. However, she also mentions that after a certain point, she
                        felt like the AI was doing things that should be reserved for her, like responding to or
                        sending out messages to other parents, and similar things that have to do with social
                        interaction or interpersonal skills.

                <div class="col-4 text-center vertical-center">
                    <p>Using AI as a surrogate for communication has been shown to have negative impacts on one's
                        interpersonal skills, and can even create unrealistic expectations on how people should or do
                        act. In Avni's case, she felt that if she continued to use AI to respond to her friends, it
                        would weaken her relationships with them and harm the connection they had. Despite this, upwards
                        of 45% of AI users plan to use it to respond to friends or coworkers' messages, potentially
                        harming their relationships with those people and their social skills (since they choose to rely
                        on the AI to communicate instead of their own ability). But this is not the
                        only way AI can harm one's relationships and interpersonal skills. There has been an uptick of
                        people talking to and treating AI as a friend in the recent years. Although at first, someone
                        who feels lonely might be soothed, it has been proven that treating AI like this can actually
                        lead to more lonliness in the end. Since AI is designed to respond exclusively positively to
                        what you say, it does not have any boundaries, and will get into no conflict with you.
                        Navigating boundaries and addressing conflict are two cornerstones of human interaction,
                        alongside emotional engagement which AI cannot truly replicate. Overall, one's social skills
                        will suffer if they rely on AI companionship.

                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI/comments/1lzzxq0/i_said_yes/">this reddit
                            post</a> (seen in figure 4), in which a person on the forum r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, says that an
                        AI has proposed to them, even including a message from said AI. Regaurdless of your thoughts on
                        this, it certainly proves that excessive use of AI can affect your real-world relationships.
                        This person has found solace in the constant affirmation and lack of pushing back from the AI to
                        the point they have supposedly married it, and it seems very likely that they may begin to
                        expect similar treatment from real people, which is certainly not a healthy outlook.

                    <p>Unfortunately, the only side for this topic is that it's extremely bad for the environement. As
                        seen in figure 5, the carbon emissions that result from ai are absolutely massive, outpacing
                        things like car manufacturing and operation which are typically the first things that come to
                        mind with carbon emissions. Additionally, you may have heard that AI uses an absurd amount of
                        water - and this is also true. In order to cool the data centers that AI rely on, large language
                        models use an average of 50ml of water <em>per prompt</em>. This might not sound like a lot, but
                        when you consider how many millions of people are prompting these AIs, its a huge amount being
                        used. Additionally, these data centers need a large amount of energy to be maintained, and many
                        of our main sources of energy in the modern day also worsen pollution. In fact, people in areas
                        near local data centers have reported a greater amount of blackouts, difficulty breathing due to
                        air pollution, and even water shortages. However, it is worth mentioning that AI can be used in
                        other environmentally detrimental fields in order to reduce the negative effects present in
                        them. As one example, AI monitoring has been shown effective in reducing the fertilizer and
                        water needs in agriculture.</p>

                    <p>Art is one of the most hot button topics when it comes to AI, with most people being staunchly
                        for or against it without even considering changing their mind. Just as a quick aside, I will be
                        talking about this in the context of visual arts, but it also applies for other forms of art
                        like music. Now, regaurdless of what you personally believe, there is no argument to be made
                        that it doesn't technically make art more accessible. For those who cannot make art for whatever
                        reason, AI being able to make it allows their creative visions come to life despite their lack
                        of ability. On top of that, it is also a great way for artists to get ideas, providing
                        inspiration for composition, color schemes, and concepts.

                    <p>Looking at the other side of things, many would argue that using AI to create art (or "art,"
                        depending on your viewpoint) loses the sense of personal touch and originality that is inherent
                        in making art. AI art lacks the "soul" that art has - the personality, emotions, and
                        imperfections that make your art <em>yours</em>. Additionally, AI always operates within a set
                        of rules, and as such will never take risks or creative liberties. This means that artists who
                        may use AI to spark inspiration might begin to feel walled in, and become unable to push
                        boundaries in the way that makes art so interesting. Furthermore, AI could take jobs away from
                        artists who would have otherwise been hired either for commision work, graphic design, and more.
                        But of course, the biggest issue lies in where AI art comes from. In order for AI to create
                        images, it scrapes millions of images from all across the internet, the large majority of which
                        is taken without the permission of the person who created the art. This means that in order to
                        make "art," AI companies are stealing art from thousands of artists and then using that data to
                        guess what their users are looking for and form images based on that. In fact, it can be a lot
                        more direct than that. Figures 7 and 8 (seen below) show two examples where someone took someone
                        else's art, fed it directly to an AI, and made their own image - effectively stealing that
                        person's art for their own use.

                    come to understand more aspects of AI's impact on society than you did before. Maybe you haven't
                    changed your mind about AI, and maybe you're still unsure on whether you think it's overall a
                    positive or negative, and that's ok. The most important thing is to remain informed on topics where
                    you hold an opinion, and I hope that my blog was able to do that for you. I also implore you to look
                    into this for yourself - there are many more topics I didn't even touch on, like
                    deepfakes/photorealistic
                    applications of AI image generation, or AI's uses in education and the positives and negatives
                    associated with that. Thank you for reading.</div>
