                    <p>As seen in figure 1, use of AI in business across the US has been steadily increasing over the
                        past few years, to where now close to 80% of businesses are using AI in some way. As AI advances
                        further, that number will continue to rise even higher. So, if so many businesses are using it,
                        it
                        must be helpful, right?

                <div class="col-4 text-center vertical-center">
                    <p>Some may be surprised to learn that the answer is actually yes. As seen in figure 2, 72% of the
                        surveyed companies who used AI "extensively" reported a high level of productivity. And this
                        makes sense - if AI can be used to perform tasks faster, of course the productivity of the
                        companies who use it is higher. Take programming, for example. An AI can potentially produce up
                        to a few hundred lines of code in a matter of seconds, serving as a pretty good initial draft
                        that the developer can work off of. In other fields, AI can improve productivity in a similar
                        way. However, you may notice that there is a significant drop in productivity when you look at
                        the companies who reported using AI "fully." This is likely due to the plethora of mistakes AI
                        can make without even realizing it, leading to extra time spent fixing those mistakes and worse
                        products overall, if said mistakes are not caught.

                        can have extremely detrimental effects when it comes to AI use in business. A business that uses
                        AI and does not catch a mistake that an AI made can lead to a completely non-functioning or
                        potentially dangerous product. In other cases, it could lead to misinformation being spread far
                        and wide, which of course can be extremely damaging in several ways.

                            post</a>, in which a person on the forum r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, says that an AI has proposed to
                        them, even including a message from said AI. Regaurdless of your thoughts on this, it certainly
                        proves that excessive use of AI can affect your real-world relationships. This person has found
                        solace in the constant affirmation and lack of pushing back from the AI to the point they have
                        supposedly married it, and it seems very likely that they may begin to expect similar treatment
                        from real people, which is certainly not a healthy outlook.

                    <p>Unfortunately, this one is pretty clear cut. It's extremely bad for the environement. As seen in
                        figure 4, the carbon emissions that result from ai are absolutely massive, outpacing things like
                        car manufacturing and operation which are typically the first things that come to mind with
                        carbon emissions. Additionally, you may have heard that AI uses an absurd amount of water - and
                        this is also true. In order to cool the data centers that AI rely on, large language models use
                        an average of 50ml of water <em>per prompt</em>. This might not sound like a lot, but when you
                        consider how many millions of people are prompting these AIs, its a huge amount being used.
                        Additionally, these data centers need a large amount of energy to be maintained, and many of our
                        main sources of energy in the modern day also worsen pollution. In fact, people in areas near
                        local data centers have reported a greater amount of blackouts, difficulty breathing due to air
                        pollution, and even water shortages. However, it is worth mentioning that AI can be used in
                        other environmentally detrimental fields in order to reduce the negative effects present in
                        them. As one example, AI monitoring has been shown effective in reducing the fertilizer and
                        water needs in agriculture.</p>

                    come to understand more aspects of AI's impact on society than you did before. Maybe you haven't
                    changed your mind about AI, and maybe you're still unsure on whether you think it's overall a
                    positive or negative, and that's ok. The most important thing is to remain informed on topics where
                    you hold an opinion, and I hope that my blog was able to do that for you. I also implore you to look
                    into this for yourself - there are more topics I didn't even touch on, like deepfakes/photorealistic
                    applications of AI image generation, or it's uses in education and the positives and negatives
                    associated with that. Thank you for reading.</div>
